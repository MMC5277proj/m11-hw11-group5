Difficulties:
- Working with GitHub - specifically merging pull requests and making sure there were no conflicts. Had to use a few workarounds at first but got better along the way
- Coordinating css sheet between members
- Issues figuring out the workflow initially
- General syling difficulties, worked it out by continuous testing

Workflow:
- Divided up work at first meeting
- Everyone was assigned a page and page specific css stylings
- Held weekly meetings to discuss code and push any changes that were made
- Following these meetings we continued to work on our individual parts and continued the regular workflow
- Due to version matching issues, there were some redundant push/pull request while we figured out exactly how those functions worked in GitHub
