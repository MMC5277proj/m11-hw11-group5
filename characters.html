            vast knowledge of 80s pop culture. He sets out on a mission to
            discover an Easter egg hidden by the platform’s creator and whoever
            finds the egg inherits control of the OASIS and a massive fortune.
            Parzival stands out for his ingenuity, and his willingness to take
            on powerful rivals...

            smart and famous egg hunter in the OASIS, known for her skills and
            independence. Like Parzival, she’s focused on finding Halliday’s
            Easter egg, but she’s also concerned about making sure the OASIS
            doesn’t end up controlled by a big corporation.

            virtual reality world in the story. Sorrento is cutthroat, and will
            do anything to find the Easter egg hidden in the OASIS, which would
            give him total control of it.

            actually a woman. She hides her real identity to stay safe and avoid
            prejudice. Aech is smart, skilled, and always helps Wade on their
