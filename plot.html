        <p>
          In 2045, people escape their harsh realities by immersing themselves
          in the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive
          Simulation), a virtual entertainment universe created by James
          Halliday and Ogden Morrow of Gregarious Games.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Halliday's death, his avatar Anorak announces a contest in a
          pre-recorded message, promising ownership of the OASIS to the first
          person who finds the golden Easter egg. This egg is hidden behind a
          gate that requires three keys, obtainable by completing three
          challenges. The contest attracts many "Gunters" (egg hunters) and
          catches the attention of Nolan Sorrento, the CEO of Innovative Online
          Industries (IOI), who seeks to control the OASIS for profit, using
          intrusive ads and a team of indentured players known as "Sixers" to
          hunt for the egg.

        <p>
          Wade Watts, a teenage orphan who goes by the avatar Parzival, is a
          dedicated Gunter. He participates in the first challenge, a difficult
          race, alongside his best friend Aech and Art3mis, a female avatar he
          likes. Parzival often visits Halliday's Journals, a simulated archive
          of Halliday's life curated by the Curator. Wade wins the Copper Key by
          cleverly driving backward during the race, followed by Aech, Art3mis,
          and friends Daito and Sho, who later form the High-5 on the OASIS
          scoreboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sorrento hires the mercenary i-R0k to uncover Wade's real identity,
          hoping to bribe him to win the contest for IOI. Wade and Art3mis
          discover in the Journals that Halliday once dated Kira, Morrow's wife.
          While searching for clues at the Distracted Globe nightclub, Wade
          confesses his feelings and true name to Art3mis. They narrowly escape
          an IOI raid, but Art3mis leaves Wade, citing her father's debt to IOI.
          i-R0k overhears their conversation and informs Sorrento, who then
          approaches Wade with a proposal. When Wade refuses, Sorrento
          retaliates by bombing Wade's home, killing his aunt Alice and her
          boyfriend Rick.
        </p>
        <p>
          Samantha Cook, the player behind Art3mis, takes Wade in. Together,
          they realize that the second challenge is tied to Halliday's regret
          about not pursuing Kira. Along with Aech, Daito, and Sho, they search
          for a recreation of the Overlook Hotel. Art3mis asks Kira to dance and
          wins the Jade Key. However, Sorrento's associate F'Nale Zandor storms
          their hideout and captures Samantha to settle her father's debt. Wade
          escapes with help from the other High-5 members in Helen's truck.
          Samantha manages to escape confinement after Aech and Parzival hack
          into Sorrento's OASIS setup and record his confession about the
          bombing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third challenge takes place in Castle Anorak on Planet Doom, where
          players must guess Halliday's favorite Atari 2600 game to earn the
          Crystal Key. i-R0k creates a force field around the castle using the
          Orb of Osuvox, but Art3mis disables it. The High-5 rallies an army of
          OASIS players against IOI. Parzival accidentally kills Samantha's
          avatar, allowing her to escape with the help of the High-5. A
          confrontation between Parzival and Sorrento leads to Sorrento
          detonating the Cataclyst bomb, wiping out all avatars on Planet Doom,
          including his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parzival respawns thanks to an extra life coin given to him by the
          Curator. He plays *Adventure* and wins the Crystal Key by finding
          Warren Robinett's Easter egg. Using all three keys, he enters a
          treasure room where Anorak presents him with a contract to sign.
          Parzival recognizes it as the one Morrow had to sign when Halliday
          forced him out of Gregarious and declines. Anorak then transforms into
          Halliday, who shares his regrets and awards Parzival the Easter egg.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sorrento and F'Nale are arrested for the bombing, and Morrow reveals
          himself as the Curator. Wade decides to run the OASIS with the High-5,
          inviting Morrow to join them as a consultant. As IOI's Loyalty Centers
          are shut down, the High-5 controversially opts to close the OASIS
          every Tuesday and Thursday, encouraging people to spend more time in
          the real world. Wade and Samantha begin a romantic relationship during
          this time.
